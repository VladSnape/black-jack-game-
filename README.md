# black-jack-game-
i tried to make a black jack game while still studying some javascript concepts for the first time like arrays and if conditionel  
im trying to make excuses for the desaster that i made. hopefully i make somthing better in the near future 
. another thing i need to work more on it is the comments and try to organize the code
